# ATTENTION
If you're reading this, the repo recently had a big update and I recommend you start from scratch.

Setup is much easier now! 
- Set port with `changeport.py` if you don't want to use the default `10000`
- Docker compose (tweak mounts first on `compose.yml`) and set all initial settings on the site itself

The readme is mostly accurate, but I'm updating it if I find any inaccuracies.

# Onboarderr v2
Onboarderr is a customizable onboarding site for a host's Plex and (optional) Audiobookshelf servers. It includes user instructions, server highlights, and an admin dashboard.

As someone who's never made a website before, I wanted to: 

- Learn about HTML, CSS, websites in general, and self-hosting
- Improve on a few "new user setup" guides I've seen for Plex
- Offer a more appealing way for friends to join my Plex
- Give me something constructive to do while unemployed lol

Admittedly, most of the code was generated by AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor). 

I handled the layout, all copywriting/instructions, collected and edited screenshots, and came up with this whole thing.

Big thanks to [@mon5termatt](https://github.com/mon5termatt) for many of the improvements in v2

# Requirements

Docker or Python (3.10+)

Plex Media Server

Method of making your local server publicly accessible:
- Tailscale w/ [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) if you're new to self-hosting. Simple and free.
- I use [Cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/) now to handle a few local service URLs I want to make public.

# Optional Requirements

[Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) Server and public URL to share with users

[Pulsarr](https://github.com/jamcalli/Pulsarr) - Per-user content requests integrated w/ Sonarr & Radarr via Plex watchlist
- Pulsarr is also able to push "media added" notifications through the Plex mobile app via Tautulli integration. Works fine for movies, but does not handle every new episode of shows. 

[Overseerr](https://github.com/sct/overseerr) - User media requesting site

[Jellyseerr](https://github.com/fallenbagel/jellyseerr) - Overseerr fork

Depending if you have Pulsarr, Overseerr, Jellyseerr, or none, some body content (section 5 on `/onboarding`) will change/disappear.

[Tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli) - Per-user specific "episode/media item added" notifications on Discord
- If a user wants notifications for each new episode of a show, I create a new private text channel that is only for them on my discord server, then use the info for that channel in Tautulli for a new notification agent. Condition for the Show Name and it directs those notifs to the channel I made.
- If Tautulli is not enabled, some body text "...ask me about my Discord" is hidden.

[Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) & [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr) - to grab the watchlisted content

Discord - to handle certain admin & user notifications

# First Time Setup

	git clone https://github.com/secretlycarl/onboarderr

	cd onboarderr


# Docker Compose Startup (Recommended)
A `compose.yml` file is included for use with Docker Compose.

Before running `docker compose up -d`, see below

### Mounting Drives for Storage Bars
To display storage bars for specific drives (e.g., E: and F: on Windows, or /mnt/e and /mnt/f on Linux), you must:

1. **Add volume mounts for each drive in your `compose.yml`** under the `volumes:` section:

- **Linux Example:**
  ```
  volumes:
    - .:/app
    - /mnt/e:/mnt/e
    - /mnt/f:/mnt/f
  ```
- **Windows Example:**
  ```
  volumes:
    - .:/app
    - E:\:/mnt/e
    - F:\:/mnt/f
  ```
2. **Set the `DRIVES` During setup or via variable in your `.env` file** to the mount points inside the container (e.g., `/mnt/e,/mnt/f`).

  > **Note:** On Windows, you may need to allow Docker Desktop access to your drives (Docker Desktop > Settings > Resources > File Sharing).

### Port Used
It runs on port `10000` by default. You can change this using the included port configuration script:

```bash
python changeport.py 8080  # Change to port 8080
python changeport.py 9000  # Change to port 9000
```

This script will automatically update all necessary files (`compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`).

Alternatively, you can manually change the port by:
1. Setting `APP_PORT=8080` in your `.env` file
2. Updating the port mapping in `compose.yml`
3. Updating the `EXPOSE` directive in `Dockerfile`

<!-- NOTES

Not sure this is needed anymore, docker compose is quicker and this takes up too much readme space

## Manual Docker Run

### Linux/macOS:
```
docker build -t onboarderr .
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr -v $(pwd):/app onboarderr
```
To include mounted drives:
```
docker run -d -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  -v /mnt/e:/mnt/e \
  -v /mnt/f:/mnt/f \
  onboarderr
```

### Windows (PowerShell):
```
docker build -t onboarderr .
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr -v ${PWD}:/app onboarderr
```
Mounted Drives version:
```
docker run -d -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr `
  --restart unless-stopped `
  -v ${PWD}:/app `
  -v E:\:/mnt/e `
  -v F:\:/mnt/f `
  onboarderr
```

### Windows (Command Prompt):
```
docker build -t onboarderr .
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr -v %cd%:/app onboarderr
```
Mounted Drives version:
```
docker run -d -p 10000:10000 --name onboarderr ^
  --restart unless-stopped ^
  -v %cd%:/app ^
  -v E:\:/mnt/e ^
  -v F:\:/mnt/f ^
  onboarderr
```

- **If you change the drives in `.env`, make sure your Docker volumes match!**
- The site will be available at `localhost:10000` (or your configured port)

-->

# Restarting the App

- **After setup or changing settings, the app will automatically restart itself to apply changes**
- You do **not** need to manually restart the container after setup or settings changes
- If you ever need to restart manually (e.g., after updating code), use:
  - `docker restart onboarderr` (for Docker)
  - `CTRL+C` then `python app.py` again (for manual/venv use)

# Manual Startup

Create and activate a venv (conda or through system python), then:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    python app.py

- It runs on port `10000` by default (or the port specified in your `.env` file via `APP_PORT`)
- Go to `http://127.0.0.1:10000` (or your configured port)

# Setup Form

- First run will bring you to [/setup](https://github.com/secretlycarl/onboarderr/blob/main/screenshots/1_setup.png). Everything here can be changed afterwards from Settings on ```/services``` (recommended) or ```.env``` 
- The library descriptions you write are saved to ```library_notes.json```, and displayed on the Plex onboarding page in section 1
- After submission, the app will restart to apply the new ```.env``` and direct you to `/login`
- ```ADMIN_PASSWORD``` will take you to services page, but you can browse the others from the links at the top
- ```SITE_PASSWORD``` will not allow access to admin page
- After submission, it will pull all posters from selected libraries for use across the site. This can take a while for large libraries, so keep an eye on the console to see when it finishes.


# !!! Per-Host Tweaks !!!


<!-- NOTES
USE https://dashboardicons.com/icons For icons. 
https://github.com/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons/tree/main/webp has all icons. 
-->

Most customization is done on setup and settings in the admin panel, but you may want to tweak some HTML contents or instructional images it comes with.

- ```onboarding_section7.html``` is personalized, you should change it to what you want it to say

- Delete placeholder ```plex_submissions.json``` and ```audiobookshelf_submissions.json```. The ones that come with it have example data to populate the requests sections on ```/services```
  
# Sharing

When ready, 
- Activate your tailscale funnel, cloudflare tunnel, or bingle tube
- Share the public URL with friends

# Updates

Option 1:
```git pull``` will try to update the repo and notify you if there are any incompatible changes, like if your customizations will overlap with anything from the update

Option 2: 

```
git stash	# temporarily saves your changes (html, css, etc)
git pull	# gets updates
git stash pop	# re-applies your changes on top
```

Setup and customization is pretty quick now (no more `.env` editing and much less html editing) so don't be afraid to start from scratch.

Keep copies of custom assets in another folder!

# Future goals

I've never made a project this complex, or had a project this many people were interested in, so I'm not clear on how the future development for this will go. I just spent like two weeks on v2.

Only missing feature I want to add is language switching. Someone already started that [here](https://github.com/secretlycarl/onboarderr/pull/24)

If you want to make it better, please do! Fork, PR, make an issue

# Thank You!

Thanks for your interest in my project! I hope you find it useful. If you want to give me a tip for putting this all together -
